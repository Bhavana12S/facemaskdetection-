# facemaskdetection-
This project aims to build a face mask detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system can detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time using images or video streams.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled images of people with and without face masks. The dataset can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset. It is divided into training, validation, and test sets.
